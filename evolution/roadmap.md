# **Framework Development Roadmap**

This roadmap outlines planned evolution of the Enterprise AIOps Bash Framework from the current v1.0 foundation. Development priorities focus on production-validated enhancements rather than speculative features.

---

## **Current State: v1.0 Foundation**

### Production-Validated Components

- **Core Framework:** Logging, security, validation modules tested in Proxmox Astronomy Lab
- **Enterprise Template:** Complete script template with error handling and operational controls
- **Documentation:** Getting started, production deployment, and security hardening guides
- **AI Integration Points:** Structured logging, parameter validation, command sandboxing

### Known Limitations

- Manual integration with AI agent frameworks
- Limited observability beyond basic logging and metrics
- No standardized plugin architecture
- Basic credential management patterns only

---

## **v1.1 - Observability Enhancement (Q1 2026)**

### Primary Goals

- Enhanced structured logging with correlation IDs
- Prometheus metrics standardization
- OpenTelemetry tracing integration
- Performance baseline establishment

### Specific Deliverables

#### Enhanced Logging Module

```bash
# Planned enhancement to logging.sh
log_with_context() {
    local level="$1"
    local message="$2"
    local correlation_id="${CORRELATION_ID:-$(generate_correlation_id)}"
    
    # Enhanced JSON logging with context
    jq -n \
        --arg ts "$(date -u +%FT%TZ)" \
        --arg level "$level" \
        --arg msg "$message" \
        --arg cid "$correlation_id" \
        --arg script "$SCRIPT_NAME" \
        '{timestamp: $ts, level: $level, message: $msg, correlation_id: $cid, script: $script}'
}
```

#### Metrics Standardization

- Standardized metric naming conventions
- Common dashboard templates for Grafana
- SLA/SLO tracking metrics for automation reliability

#### Tracing Integration

- OpenTelemetry span creation functions
- W3C Trace Context propagation
- Integration examples with Jaeger and Zipkin

### Success Criteria

- All scripts emit correlated, structured telemetry
- Framework performance baselines established
- End-to-end tracing from AI agent to system action

---

## **v1.2 - AI Agent Integration Patterns (Q2 2026)**

### Primary Goals

- Standardized AI agent communication protocols
- Enhanced parameter validation for ML-generated inputs
- AI safety patterns for autonomous operations
- Agent behavior observability

### Specific Deliverables

#### Agent Communication Protocol

```bash
# Planned agent interface standardization
execute_for_agent() {
    local agent_context="$1"
    local operation="$2"
    shift 2
    local parameters=("$@")
    
    # Validate agent context and operation
    validate_agent_context "$agent_context"
    validate_operation_scope "$operation"
    
    # Enhanced parameter validation for ML inputs
    validate_ml_parameters "${parameters[@]}"
    
    # Execute with agent-specific logging
    run_with_agent_context "$operation" "${parameters[@]}"
}
```

#### Enhanced Validation Framework

- ML-specific input validation patterns
- Confidence score integration for AI-generated parameters
- Fallback behaviors for low-confidence AI decisions

#### Safety Controls

- Expanded command allow-lists based on operational context
- Automated rollback triggers for failed AI actions
- Human approval workflows for high-risk operations

### Success Criteria

- AI agents can safely execute scripts with minimal human oversight
- All AI-initiated actions are traceable and auditable
- Framework prevents common AI agent failure modes

---

## **v1.3 - Plugin Architecture (Q3 2026)**

### Primary Goals

- Modular plugin system for framework extensions
- Third-party integration standardization
- Community contribution framework
- Backward compatibility maintenance

### Specific Deliverables

#### Plugin System

```bash
# Planned plugin architecture
load_plugin() {
    local plugin_name="$1"
    local plugin_path="/opt/enterprise-automation/plugins/$plugin_name"
    
    # Validate plugin security and compatibility
    validate_plugin_security "$plugin_path"
    verify_plugin_compatibility "$plugin_path" "$FRAMEWORK_VERSION"
    
    # Load plugin with sandboxing
    source "$plugin_path/plugin.sh"
}
```

#### Standard Plugin Types

- **Credential Managers:** Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault
- **Monitoring Integrations:** Datadog, New Relic, SolarWinds
- **Notification Systems:** PagerDuty, Slack, Microsoft Teams
- **Cloud Providers:** AWS, Azure, GCP automation extensions

#### Plugin Development Kit

- Plugin template and development guidelines
- Testing framework for plugin validation
- Security review process for community plugins

### Success Criteria

- Framework extensible without core modification
- Plugin ecosystem supports common enterprise integrations
- Community contributions possible with security review

---

## **v2.0 - Hybrid Architecture (Q4 2026)**

### Primary Goals

- Seamless Python-Bash integration for complex workflows
- Advanced AI agent orchestration capabilities
- Enterprise-scale deployment patterns
- Performance optimization for high-volume operations

### Specific Deliverables

#### Python Integration Layer

- Standardized Python-to-Bash communication protocols
