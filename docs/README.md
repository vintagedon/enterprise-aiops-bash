## Common Use Cases

### For DevOps Teams

- **Automated Infrastructure Management:** Use validated, secure scripts for server provisioning and configuration
- **Incident Response:** AI agents execute pre-approved remediation scripts with full observability
- **Compliance Automation:** SOX/GDPR compliant automation with comprehensive audit trails

### For AI/ML Engineers

- **AIOps Integration:** Framework serves as secure execution layer for AI agent actions
- **Observability:** Full-spectrum telemetry (logs, metrics, traces) for AI system monitoring
- **Safety Controls:** Built-in guardrails prevent AI agents from executing dangerous operations

### For Security Teams

- **Zero-Trust Execution:** All script parameters validated before execution
- **Credential Management:** Integration with HashiCorp Vault and other secret managers
- **Audit Compliance:** Structured logging and security event monitoring

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- Linux environment (Ubuntu 20.04+, RHEL 8+, Amazon Linux 2)
- Bash 4.4+ (standard on modern systems)
- Basic utilities: `jq`, `curl`, `git`

### Recommended Knowledge

- Basic bash scripting experience
- Understanding of system administration concepts
- Familiarity with monitoring and logging practices

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution | Reference |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Permission denied errors | Check user/group ownership | [Production Guide - Access Control](production-deployment.md#access-control) |
| jq command not found | Install jq package | [Getting Started - Prerequisites](getting-started.md#prerequisites) |
| Scripts fail in dry-run | Review parameter validation | [Security Guide - Input Validation](security-hardening.md#input-validation-framework) |

### Getting Help

- **Documentation Issues:** Check the specific guide's troubleshooting section
- **Implementation Questions:** Review the enterprise template examples
- **Security Concerns:** Consult the security hardening guide

## Contributing to Documentation

### Documentation Standards

- Follow the kb-general-template.md structure for consistency
- Include working code examples that can be copy-pasted
- Focus on practical implementation over theoretical concepts
- Validate all technical content against the framework

### Quality Guidelines

- **Clarity:** Each document should have a clear, single purpose
- **Completeness:** Provide enough information for independent implementation
- **Accuracy:** All examples tested and validated in production-like environments
- **Maintenance:** Regular updates to reflect framework evolution

## Framework Philosophy

**AI-Native Design:** Built specifically for AI agent execution with safety controls and observability
**Production-Ready:** Validated in real enterprise environments with comprehensive error handling
**Security-First:** Every component designed with zero-trust principles for AI agent interactions
**Operational Excellence:** Full observability stack with structured logging, metrics, and tracing

This framework bridges the gap between AI intelligence and reliable system execution, providing the "last mile" infrastructure that transforms AI insights into safe, auditable actions.
